# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of funding requests from nonprofits. First, I pre-processed the data by binning, encoding, and scaling. Then, using TensorFlow, I designed a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict whether an organization will be successful in utilizing grants. This repository contains an initial attempt, which produced a model with 72.9% accuracy, and an optimized model with 78.2% accuracy.
